# Channel Frontend Contract

Use this reference when the target surface is `channel_site`, `cross_channel_sync`, or `template_mapping`.

## First-Class Target

GEOFlow Agent channels are the first-class channel frontend target. WordPress REST and Generic API channels can receive article/content payloads and selected settings, but the skill must not assume they render GEOFlow homepage modules.

## Settings Contract

Channel frontend experience lives in `distribution_channels.site_settings` plus `distribution_channels.channel_config`.

`site_settings` may include:

- `site_name`, `site_subtitle`, `site_description`, `site_keywords`
- `copyright_info`, `site_logo`, `site_favicon`
- `seo_title_template`, `seo_description_template`
- `featured_limit`, `per_page`
- `homepage_style`
- `homepage_modules`
- `home_carousel_slides`

Default-site `homepage_modules` may include `lead_form` modules. Channel payloads must be filtered against the target package's live or cached `supported_modules` before sync.

`channel_config` may include:

- `frontend_experience_mode`
- `article_text_ad_policy`
- `frontend_capabilities_cache`
- channel-type-specific transport settings

`frontend_capabilities_cache` is a non-sensitive GeoFlow Agent capability snapshot. It may contain:

- `status`, `checked_at`, `message`, `reachable`
- `package_version`, `capability_version`
- `active_theme`, `front_mode`, `frontend_experience_mode`
- `supported_modules`, `supported_routes`
- `supports_homepage_style`, `supports_home_carousel_slides`, `supports_article_text_ads`, `supports_static_generation`
- `agent_base_url`

Target payload should include:

- `active_theme`
- `front_mode`
- `frontend_experience_mode`
- `homepage_style`
- `homepage_modules`
- `home_carousel_slides`
- `article_text_ads`

Sync previews and capability reports should summarize:

- `active_theme`
- `front_mode`
- `frontend_experience_mode`
- homepage module count and module types
- carousel slide count
- homepage style token keys
- text ad module count

GeoFlow Agent targets may expose `/geoflow-agent/v1/frontend-capabilities`. Treat this as the live remote support contract for package version, supported modules, supported routes, current theme, current `front_mode`, carousel support, homepage style support, and article text ad support.

Backend pages and `php artisan geoflow:frontend-experience <channel_id> --json` should read the cache by default. Use `--live-remote` or the admin refresh action only when a fresh remote read is required; live reads through the command do not persist the cache.

Sync confirmation uses a preview-first flow:

- single channel: `GET distribution/{channelId}/sync-settings/preview`
- all active GeoFlow Agent channels: `GET distribution/sync-settings-all/preview`
- selected channels: `POST distribution/sync-settings-selected/preview`
- confirmed sync: original sync POST plus `frontend_sync_confirmed=1`

## Experience Modes

- `inherit_default`: channel uses the current default-site frontend experience at sync time.
- `snapshot_default`: channel copies the current default-site frontend experience when saved, then diverges safely.
- `custom`: channel uses its own JSON settings.

## Module Semantics

The shared module vocabulary is:

- `hero`
- `rich_text`
- `image_band`
- `metric_band`
- `chart_band`
- `feature_grid`
- `article_collection`
- `cta_band`
- `custom_html`

The default site may additionally support `lead_form` with `lead_form_slug`. Do not assume a GeoFlow Agent target package can render `lead_form` unless `/geoflow-agent/v1/frontend-capabilities` explicitly includes it in `supported_modules`.

`article_collection` must use `data_source` values from `featured`, `hot`, and `latest`. Remote article payloads need `is_featured` and `is_hot` for this to work.

If a target package lacks `lead_form`, use one of these reviewed fallbacks before sync:

- replace it with a `cta_band` linking to `/forms/{slug}` on the default site or a channel-specific public form URL
- remove the module from channel payload and report the omission
- require target package upgrade before syncing the original module

## Skill Guardrails

- Prefer JSON settings and synchronization over editing remote PHP/Blade.
- Keep default-site identity fields and channel-site identity fields separate from homepage experience fields.
- Treat channel sync as a finalize step that requires operator review.
- Do not map unsupported external systems to GEOFlow renderer guarantees.
- Never silently sync unsupported module types just because the default site can render them.
